This is a cononical ROS for android library, meant to provide a swiss army knife
of functionality to any poor soul who wishes to create android apps that use ROS.

Not really useful standalone, see the apps directory.

BUILDING: (see: http://ros.org/wiki/android_core )

android update lib-project --path . --target android-17
android update lib-project --path . --library <path>/<to>/android_core/android_gingerbread_mr1/
./gradlew debug
