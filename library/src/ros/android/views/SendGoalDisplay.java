/**
 * PanZoomDisplay which implements a draggable goal-pose setter.
 *
 * The control has two parts: a central circle for translation and a
 * smaller outboard circle for rotation.
 *
 * Behavior: When the display is enabled and a goal has not yet been
 * set, the pose is set by incoming Matrices via the Posable interface
 * (i.e. originating from TF messages describing where the robot
 * thinks it currently is.
 *
 * When the user touches inside one of the control circles, those
 * incoming Poses are ignored and the pose is updated by the user's
 * drag gestures.
 *
 * After the user lets go, the pose stays the same until the display
 * times out.  (Timeout implemented in PoseInputDisplay).
